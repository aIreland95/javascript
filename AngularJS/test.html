strings can be used as a variable, keep an eye on quotation on specific strings
object initilization: ng-init="person={firstName:'John', lastName:'Doe'}"
calling the previously created object: person.firstName, person.lastName
arrays: initialize, then call a value using its index
module: create a module using angular.module("myApp", []) - this will be contained in script tags;
controller: use ng-controller and call it with app.controller("myCtrl", function($scope){}) within script tags
directives: used for adding functionality,
modules and controllers are typically contained inside of a js file, add an src to script tags
Angular functions will remain local, reducing global issues
ng-repeat - repeats an HTML element, similar to a for loop
restrict used to invoke directives by a specified method, like by element or attribute

ng-model adds or removes classes according to a form field's status
data-vinding, the synchronization between the model and view.
angular controllers control theta of applications
scope is the binding tool between HTML and JavaScript
